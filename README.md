# Java Console Calculator

This is a basic calculator application built using Java. It works entirely through the console (CMD/Terminal) and allows the user to perform simple mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### üí° Purpose:
I created this project as part of my internship task to strengthen my understanding of Java fundamentals such as:
- User input handling using Scanner
- Method creation and usage
- Switch statements
- Loops and conditionals
- Basic error handling (e.g., divide by zero)

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:
- The user is prompted to select an operation: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`.
- Then, the user inputs two numbers.
- The result is shown immediately.
- The calculator keeps running in a loop until the user types `'q'` to quit.

### üì¶ Tools Used:
- **Java (JDK 17)** for coding
- **VS Code** for writing and testing the code
- **Command Prompt/Terminal** to run the program

### üìå Note:
- This is a console-only application (no GUI used).
- I wrote all the logic manually without using any prebuilt calculator libraries or online code generators.
- The main focus was to practice coding structure, logic flow, and clean method-based programming in Java.

### üß† What I Learned:
- Writing clean and readable methods
- Taking user input safely
- Controlling program flow using conditions and loops
- How to organize code better for real-world scenarios
